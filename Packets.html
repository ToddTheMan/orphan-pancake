<h1>Packets, Routers, and Redundancy</h1>
<h2>Packets</h2>
<p>Data is often far too big to be sent as one whole piece, in such cases, it is sent as packets ranging from hundreds to millons.</p>
<br>
<p>These packets each contain a little bit of information, and when sent to your computer they combine to form the orginal thing that your computer requested</p>
<br>
<p>Packets only have a bit of information on them: where they are from, where they are going, and ,sometimes, their order number</p>
<br>
<h2>Routers<h2>
<p>Routers help rout packets toward there destination; ferrying the packets onward by choosing the cheapest path for them to get to there destination</p>
<br>
<p>Routers often act like traffic managers,if one route is clogged it will send packets to other routes beacuase of this: Packets don't awayls travel the most direct route</p>
<br>
<h2>TCP</h2>
<p>Beacuase packets take a varitety of routes and sometimes don't always arive the internet has has a protocol to make sure that the data from packets is sent reliabley </p>
<br>
<p>TCP (Transmisson Control Protical) checks to make sure each packet is present and reorders them correctily. If some packets are missing it requests them again,thus, ensuring that everything is delivered.</p>
<br>
<p>However, TCP cuases the data to be sent slower, so, for cerntian platforms (like videochats) TCP is not used</p>

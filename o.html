	<h1>what is the internet?</h1>
	
	<p>the internet is a worldwide network connecting every single device on the planet. It only manages this beacuase of a set of well constrced and genuis protocols developed by Bob Khan and Vint Cerf (the creators of the internet)</p>
	<br>
	<p>one of the things that make the internet great is the fact that nobody is in charge of it. This allowes for a great degree of freedom and the ability for others to see other opinons and means of expressoin</p>
<br>
	<p>But, the best thing about the internet is that it is designed to scale; as it grows it becomes more efficent and relabile rather than crumbling under the strain. And with humman poupulation rapidily growing this is a blessing.</p>
